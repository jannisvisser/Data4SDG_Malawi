2. From the command line go to the folder (cd C:/folder) and set up a local http-server (simply type: 'http-server' once you're in the folder.)
NOTE: You do need to install this node module first through 'npm install -g http-server'. 
NOTE2: And for this you need to install NPM first, by downloading Node.JS (https://nodejs.org/en/) and running 'npm install npm -g' from  the command line afterwards.
3. Once the http-server is set up: go to http://localhost:8080/ to view the dashboard.
